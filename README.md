# Scaling Civilizational Knowledge
This article forms an early proof of concept of a knowledge technology, and can be read using this frontend: [Knowledge Index](https://knowledge.lukadover.com).

Briefly, it's an experiment if we could transition knowledge to the realm of software, where articles are published in the form of software libraries, which others can build upon and extend.
