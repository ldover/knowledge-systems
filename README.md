# Scaling Civilizational Knowledge
We have perfected our information systems — pretty much everyone 
has access to abundant information — and yet as
civilization we seem more prone to ignorance than ever.
In this article we begin sketching out a conceptual
framework to help us understand this dichotomy.
We use principles from Austrian economics to differentiate
between information systems and knowledge systems, and explore
the first principles of the latter.
Just as the first principles of information theory helped
us scale our information systems to a global level,
our hope is that understanding the first principles
of knowledge systems will help us design and engineer
large-scale knowledge systems that are more useful to
society and make us wiser.
