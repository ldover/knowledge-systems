  "description": "We have perfected our information systems — pretty much everyone has access to abundant information — and yet as civilization we seem more prone to ignorance than ever. In this article we begin sketching out a conceptual framework to help us understand this dichotomy. We use principles from Austrian economics to differentiate between information systems and knowledge systems and explore the first principles of the latter. Just as the first principles of information theory helped us scale our information systems to a global level, our hope is that understanding the first principles of knowledge systems will help us design and engineer large-scale knowledge systems that are more useful to society and make us wiser.",
